Dynamic Dictionary Chrome Extension

Simple Chrome Extension Prototype Application. Gets activated by key
shortcuts for the convenience and pull out 'definitions' from MySQL database
then sending result to application via Ajax. I personally used WAMP
server for the testing. Since, it is just a working prototype application,
server and database need to installed and set by those would want to try
it out.
