Dynamic Dictionary Chrome Extension

Simple Chrome Extension Prototype Application. Gets activated by key
shortcuts for convenience and pull out 'definitions' from MySQL database
then sending result to application using Ajax. I personally used WAMP
server for the testing. Since, it is just a working prototype application,
server and database need to installed and set by those would want to try
it out.
